En adelante, se intentara seguir las siguientes convenciones:


NAMING:

- Functions

  Function names should start with the name of the module they belong
  followed with a _ and the proper function name.
  The "proper" name should be a verb, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase, with the first
  letter of each internal word capitalized.

  Ex:
     module1_run();
     module2_runFast();
     module3_getBackground();



- Variables

  Mixed case with a lowercase first letter. Internal words start with capital
  letters. Variable names should not start with underscore _ or dollar sign $
  characters, even though both are allowed.
  Global variable names should start with the name of the module they belong
  followed with a _ and the proper variable name

  Variable names should be short yet meaningful. The choice of a variable name
  should be mnemonic- that is, designed to indicate to the casual observer the
  intent of its use. One-character variable names should be avoided except for
  temporary "throwaway" variables. Common names for temporary variables are i,
  j, k, m, and n for integers; c, d, and e for characters.

  Ex:
     extern int      module_i;
     char            c;
     float           myWidth;




- Constants

  Should be all uppercase with words separated by underscores ("_").
